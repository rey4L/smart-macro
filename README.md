## Overview

A simple python macro that utilizes computer vision (specifically template matching) and the `pyautogui` library to help automate farming in the popular gacha game Bleach Brave Souls, but can be adapted to function in any environment involving interactive buttons.

### Usage

1. Install required libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. In the `src` directory, edit `config.json` to include the location of your templates and the sensitivity of the algorithm. (Accepted values are 0-1, where the higher the number the more strict the algorithm will be).
3. Run the script (located in the `scripts` directory):
   1. On Windows execute `run.bat`.
   2. On Linux execute `run.sh`.
